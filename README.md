## Summary

This project was sort of a re-introduction for myself to learn React basics. This app uses a class and functional component, with the state being handled in the class component. Props are being delivered to the expense table from the form component and styling is being handled by React Bootstrap. This app is also deployed through Heroku, which is an amazing service -- 10/10.
